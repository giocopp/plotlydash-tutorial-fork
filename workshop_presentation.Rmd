# Introduction

Data visualization is a powerful mean to understand complex data and communicate insights effectively, revealing the hidden patterns and trends that wouldn't be obvious in tabular data, turning raw data into information.

### Why interactive graphics?  `r emo::ji("graph")`
* Engagement: Makes data come alive (interactive) and is more engaging for users. This increase understanding and retention.
* Depth: Allows users to drill down and explore nuances, as interaction allows to create narratives more easily. Users can ask 'why' and get answers instantly by exploring the chart or graph.
* Decision-making: Facilitates more informed decisions.

**What tools allow to do so?**...
Plotly and Dash! And we will introduce both!

# Plotly `r emo::ji("??")`
* What is Plotly?A powerful R library to create interactive and visually appealing graphs.
* Advantages of using Plotly.
    - Seamless integration with R.
    - Diverse range of plots and customization (wide array of chart types with extensive customization options).
    - Web integration of graphs, makes visualization more accessible and intuitive.

### Quick visualization example.
A cool, non-trivial, yet not too complex, visualization that encapsulate the power of Plotly:

Let's create track the rise of craft beer production across the US over time with the [Beer Consumption by US State Data](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/blob/master/beers.csv). `r emo::ji("beer")`, for example ???
